## Deployment
Algorithms in Action is written in JavaScript, using the React framework. To make it work locally, you need to install Node.js. NPM (Node package manager) will be installed alongside when you install Node.js. We use express framework to implement our back-end

Ensure you have node version 14.x and npm version 6.x
To check your version, type
node --version 
npm --version

Navigate into front and back folder seperately and run npm install to install all independecies in package.json

Running on local 
Navigate into front and back folder separtely and run npm start, it will start both front and back-end side of web
Front-end side of client will run in port 3000, and will be launched at browser http://localhost:3000
Back-end of client side and admin will run in port 8000
Front-end of admin side will run in 3001, and will be launched at browser http://localhost:3001

Demo
We have two demos that should activate simultaneously to run our app.
First use https://new-bee-crm.herokuapp.com/ to start the server
Then use https://new-bees.netlify.app to start the front-end of client side

We have enabled automatic deploying of both webites. If we commited changes on our repo, the website will automatically updated to the newest version.

The CI of https://new-bees.netlify.app is CI=npm run build
The CI of https://new-bee-crm.herokuapp.com/ is CI=npm start
